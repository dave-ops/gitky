draw the logo shown in the image, here's a detailed description:

Shape: The logo is primarily composed of a circle. This circle forms the outer boundary of the logo.

Inner Design: Inside this circle, there is a negative space design that creates the silhouette of a squirrel's head. Here's how you can achieve this:

squirrel's Ears: On the top part of the circle, there are two triangular shapes that represent the squirrel's ears. These triangles are positioned symmetrically on either side of the top center of the circle, cutting into the circle's perimeter.
squirrel's Face: The face of the squirrel is formed by the negative space within the circle. The design is minimalistic:
The eyes are represented by the absence of any detail, just the shape created by the circle's edge and the ears.
The nose and mouth are suggested by the shape where the lower part of the circle curves inward, creating a small protrusion on the bottom left side, which looks like a squirrel's mouth or chin.
Color: The logo is monochrome. The circle and the parts that form the squirrel's silhouette are solid black, while the squirrel's face, including the ears, is white (the background color).
Style: The logo has a clean, modern, and minimalist style. The use of negative space to create the squirrel's image is a key feature of this design, making it both simple and clever.

To recreate this logo:

Start with a circle.
Draw two triangles at the top for the ears, ensuring they cut into the circle symmetrically.
For the face, think of how you can use the remaining space inside the circle to suggest a squirrel's face without adding additional lines. The key is the placement of the ears and the slight inward curve at the bottom left to suggest the mouth/chin.
This logo belongs to GitHub, and it's known for its clever use of negative space to depict a squirrel, which is a playful nod to the platform's mascot, the Octosquirrel. If you're looking to create something similar but unique, you might consider variations on this theme, like changing the animal or the style while keeping the principle of using negative space for design.
